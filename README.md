# Data Engineering Nano Degree
Projects for the nanodegree in Data Engineering from Udacity.

So far this contains a few projects, each with a different implementation on top of the same data:

Each project attempts to create a star schema of data from JSON files around song and event info for a music app, 'Sparkify'. The difference in implementations mostly comes from the technology used:
- PostGresSQL
- Cassandra
- Redshift (AWS)
- Spark on EMR (AWS)
